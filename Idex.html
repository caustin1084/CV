          <h2>Personal Statement</h2>

          <p>Hello, my name is Chanelle Austin, and I am passionate about my community.
            I believe it is my life’s mission to gain knowledge of the
            United States Food System and how our daily dietary habits are
            affecting our health and wellness. I enjoy
            sharing my knowledge with others and challenging myself
            to always learn more.

            I began my journey for knowledge of food by attending
            Johnson and Wales University, where I completed a Bachelor
            of Science in Food Service Management with a concentration
            in Sustainability. Next, I enrolled in a year-long farmer apprenticeship.
            Which introduced husbandry, sustainable animal management,
            and growing and harvesting certified organic vegetables.
            In my future studies, I will continue my education
            and include knowledge of herbs and dietary supplements.

            In addition to my degree and certification,
            I also have more than five years of experience in hospitality.
            This experience has empowered me to take on leadership roles,
            provide exceptional customer service, and solve difficult concerns of
            customers, co-workers, and businesses alike.
